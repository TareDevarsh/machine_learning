#Machine_learning
Test codes for TensorFlow machine learning using google colab Notebooks 

Regression_test:
    Using Titanic Survivors dataser and Linear Classification modle to predict the probabilty of     person on the ship surviving the Ice berg Collapse.(Project was taken from Tensorflow Tutorials)


petal_test:
    Basic model for indicating the flower species using 4 features.(Project was taken from Tensorflow Tutorials)
    

Stock_analysis:
    Model for predicting Apple stock prices. Two files using the same models. One imports pretrained model while other file Trains the models similar to other algorithms
