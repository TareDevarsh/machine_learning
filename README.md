## Regression_test

This project utilizes the Titanic Survivors dataset and a Linear Classification model to predict the probability of a person on the ship surviving the iceberg collapse. The project was adapted from TensorFlow Tutorials.

### Usage

- Run the Regression_test.ipynb` script to apply the linear regression model to the Titanic Survivors dataset.

## petal_test

This project involves a basic model for indicating flower species using four features. The project structure and code were inspired by TensorFlow Tutorials.

### Usage

- Execute the `petal_test.ipynb` script to apply the basic model for flower species classification.

## Stock_analysis

This project includes a model for predicting Apple stock prices. There are two files within the projectâ€”one imports a pretrained model, while the other file trains the model using similar algorithms.

### Usage

- Run the `Stock_anaysis_pretrained.ipynb` script to use the pretrained model.
- Execute the `Stock_market_RNN.ipynb` script to train the model with additional algorithms.

## covid19_analysis

This project focuses on predicting future confirmed COVID-19 cases using Facebook's Prophet. The predictions are based on the current 2020 pandemic situation.

### Usage

- Run the `covid19_anaysis.ipynb` script to predict future COVID-19 cases using Facebook's Prophet.

## time_series

This project involves predicting time series data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

### Usage

- Execute the `Time_series_data.ipynb` script to apply LSTM for time series prediction.
